# Mathematical-Graphs
Plotting Mathematical Equations using Python Program developed by Abigith
This python program uses Matplot and numpy libraries to generate the following graphs:
      "1. sinx"
      "2. cosx"
      "3. tanx"
      "4. e^x "
      "5. e^2x"
      "6. e^-x"
      "7. e^-2x"
      "8. e^x^2"
      "9. e^-x^2"
